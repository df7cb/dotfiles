" DESCRIPTION
"     This file is a Vim ftplugin for editing PO files (GNU gettext -- the GNU
"     i18n and l10n system). It automates over a dozen frequent tasks that
"     occur while editing files of this type.

"
"     Remarks:
"     - "S" in the above key mappings stands for the <Shift> key and "\" in
"       fact means "<LocalLeader>" (:help <LocalLeader>), which is "\" by
"       Vim's default.
"     - Information about the translator and language team is supplied by two
"       global variables: 'g:po_translator' and 'g:po_lang_team'. They should
"       be defined in the ".vimrc" (UNIX) or "_vimrc" (Windows) file. If they
"       are not defined, the default values (descriptive strings) are put
"       instead.
"     - Vim's "gf" Normal mode command is remapped (local to the PO buffer, of
"       course). It will only function on lines starting with "#: ". Search
"       for the file is performed in the directories specified by the 'path'
"       option. The user can supply its own addition to this option via the
"       'g:po_path' global variable. Its default value for PO files can be
"       found by typing ":set path?" from within a PO buffer. For the correct
"       format please see ":help 'path'". Warning messages are printed if no
"       or more than one file is found.
"     - Vim's Quickfix mode (see ":help quickfix") is used for browsing
"       through msgfmt-reported errors for the file. No MO file is created
"       when running the msgfmt program since its output is directed to
"       "/dev/null". The user can supply command-line arguments to the msgfmt
"       program via the global variable 'g:po_msgfmt_args'. All arguments are
"       allowed except the "-o" for output file. The default value is
"       "-vv -c".
"
"     But there's even more!
"
"     Every time the PO file is saved, a PO-formatted time stamp is
"     automatically added to the file header.
"
" INSTALLATION
"     Put this file in a Vim ftplugin directory. On UNIX computers it is
"     usually either "~/.vim/ftplugin" or "~/.vim/after/ftplugin". On Windows
"     computers, the defaults are "$VIM\vimfiles\ftplugin" or
"     "$VIM\vimfiles\after\ftplugin". For more information consult the Vim
"     help, ":help 'ftplugin'" and ":help 'runtimepath'".
"
" REMOVAL
"     Just delete the bloody file!
